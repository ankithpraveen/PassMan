# PassMan

## Overview

Welcome to the Password Manager Project, a comprehensive exploration of password management implementations with a focus on Rust and C++. This repository comprises various components, including basic password managers, benchmarking tools, concurrent password managers, and simple encryption examples.

## Project Structure

### Password Manager Implementations

- **Rust Password Manager**: A basic password manager written in Rust.
- **C++ Password Manager**: A basic password manager written in C++.

### Benchmarking Tools

- **Rust Password Manager Benchmark**: Benchmarking code in Rust, showcasing memory usage and time metrics for encryption and decryption.
- **C++ Password Manager Benchmark**: Similar to its Rust counterpart, this folder contains benchmarking tools implemented in C++.

### Concurrent Password Managers

- **Concurrent Rust Password Manager**: Rust implementation featuring server and client code with threading for concurrent operation.
- **Concurrent C++ Password Manager**: C++ counterpart demonstrating concurrency with server and client threads.

### Simple Encryption Examples

- **Rust Simple Encryption**: Basic encryption and decryption in Rust for performance comparison.
- **C++ Simple Encryption**: A parallel simple encryption and decryption program written in C++.

## Usage

Navigate to each component's folder for detailed instructions on building, running, and testing. Make sure to check the respective README files.
