## Explanation

The benchmarking results indicate that, on average, the Rust implementations perform better in terms of both time and memory usage compared to their C++ counterparts. However, it's noteworthy that in the case of simple encryption-decryption, Rust exhibits longer execution times.

This discrepancy in simple encryption-decryption times may be attributed to various factors, including language-specific optimizations, library choices, and the nature of the algorithms implemented. While Rust excels in system-level programming and memory safety, the observed differences emphasize the importance of considering the specific use case and requirements when selecting a programming language for security-related applications.
